            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>It all began when all the Greek gods, except Eris (the goddess of discord and strife), were invited to
                the wedding of the glorious mortal Peleus and the goddess Thetis. Out of revenge and jealousy, Eris
                threw a golden apple to the crowd with an inscription reading “to the fairest”. Aphrodite Hera and
                Athena were all in the same crowd. they all looked down on the apple claiming it belonged to them, and
                so they began deciding who was the most beautiful. They took this decision to the Trojan prince Paris.
                The three goddesses got undressed in front of Paris and asked him to choose who was the most beautiful
                and he couldn’t decide so the goddesses resorted in bribing him.</p>

    <h3>The History</h3>
    <p id="historySection1">The Apple of Discord is an ancient Greek myth that follows the tale of the golden apple that
        was dropped by Eris, Greek goddess of Discord and Strife. The apple was dropped during the wedding of Peleus
        (son of Aeacus and king of Aegina), and Thetis (a sea nymph and a goddess of the sea). Eris, who was offended
        for being the only uninvited god in the joyous event, vindictively dropped the apple among three powerful
        goddesses: Athena, Aphrodite, and Hera.</p>
    <div id="historySection2">
        <p>The apple was inscribed with the words “To the fairest”, which eventually led to a vanity-fueled argument
            among the three goddesses. Zeus, God of Thunder (who would usually handle petty disputes), did not want to
            risk offending any of the goddesses so he left the responsibility to the Trojan prince, Paris, to provide
            the apple to the worthiest goddess. Each of the three goddesses offered Paris a unique gift if he chose one
            of them.</p>
        <div class="historyImage" id="historyImage1"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="historySection3">
        <div class="historyImage" id="historyImage2"></div>
        <p>Goddess Athena offered unmatched wisdom and skill in war. Alongside her, Hera offered power and domination
            over all of Asia. Lastly, Aphrodite offered the most beautiful woman in the world, who was none other
            than Helen of Sparta (who, at the time, was already married to King Menelaus of Sparta). Tempted by
            Aphrodite's offer, Paris ultimately accepted Aphrodite’s offer and pursued Helen of Sparta,
            allowing Aphrodite to steal Helen and enchant her with love for him, which eventually started the Trojan
            war.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="historySection4">
        <div class="historyImage" id="historyImage3"></div>
        <p>The war between the Trojans and the Achaeans lasted 10 years, all due to the dispute of who claimed Helen.
            Eventually, the war came to an end in the Achaeans' favor, and as a result, Helen was given back to
            Menelaus. Regardless, despite how much he loved Helen in the past, he was intending to kill her as soon as
            she was returned. However, as Helen was kneeling for Menelaus' mercy, he eventually softened up and offered
            to spare her life if she killed her two perfect children that she had with Paris. To which she hastily
            agrees.</p>

            <h6>The Apple of Discord</h6>
            <p>Inscribed with the words “To the Fairest” was a petty trick to stir up scandal upon the gods, caused by
                Eris’s spite towards the fact that she was the only uninvited god to the wedding. This small act
                eventually led
                to the Trojan War. Now, it is also a saying for when something small turns catastrophic, as in “sowing
                the seeds
                of discord”.</p>
