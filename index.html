            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>It all began when all the Greek gods, except Eris (nymph goddess of discord and strife), were invited to
                the wedding of the glorious mortal Peleus and the goddess Thetis. Out of revenge and jealousy, Eris
                threw a golden apple to the crowd with an inscription reading “To the Fairest.” Aphrodite, Hera, and
                Athena were all in the same crowd, and they all looked down on the apple, claiming it belonged to them.
                Hence, they began deciding who was the most beautiful, though ultimately, they took this decision to
                Trojan Prince Paris. The three goddesses got undressed in front of Paris and asked him to choose who was
                the most beautiful, though because he couldn’t decide, the goddesses resorted to bribing him.</p>

    <h3>The History</h3>
    <p id="historySection1">The Apple of Discord is an ancient Greek myth that followed the tale of the golden apple
        that
        was dropped by Eris, Greek nymph goddess of Discord and Strife. The apple was dropped during the wedding of
        Peleus
        (son of Aeacus and king of Aegina), and Thetis (a sea nymph and a goddess of the sea). Eris, who was offended
        for being the only uninvited god in the joyous event, vindictively dropped the apple among three powerful
        goddesses: Athena, Aphrodite, and Hera.</p>
    <div id="historySection2">
        <p>The apple was inscribed with the words “To the fairest,” which eventually led to a vanity-fueled argument
            among the three goddesses. Zeus, God of Thunder (who would usually handle petty disputes) did not want to
            risk offending any of the goddesses, so he left the responsibility to the Trojan prince, Paris, to provide
            the apple to the worthiest goddess. Each of the three goddesses offered Paris a unique gift to earn his
            favor.</p>
        <div class="historyImage" id="historyImage1"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="historySection3">
        <div class="historyImage" id="historyImage2"></div>
        <p>Goddess Athena offered unmatched wisdom and skill in war. Alongside her, Hera offered power and domination
            over all of Asia. Lastly, Aphrodite offered the most beautiful woman in the world, who was none other
            than Helen of Sparta (who, at the time, was already married to King Menelaus of Sparta). Tempted by
            Aphrodite's offer, Paris ultimately accepted her offer and pursued Helen of Sparta,
            allowing Aphrodite to steal Helen and enchant her with love for him, which eventually started the Trojan
            war.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="historySection4">
        <div class="historyImage" id="historyImage3"></div>
        <p>The war between the Trojans and the Achaeans lasted 10 years, all due to the dispute of who claimed Helen.
            Eventually, the war came to an end in the Achaeans' favor, and as a result, Helen was given back to
            Menelaus. Regardless, despite how much he loved Helen in the past, he was intending to kill her as soon as
            she was returned. However, as Helen was kneeling for Menelaus' mercy, he eventually softened up and offered
            to spare her life if she killed her two perfect children that she had with Paris. To which she hastily
            agrees.</p>

            <h6>The Apple of Discord</h6>
            <p>Inscribed with the words “To the Fairest.” This act was a petty trick to stir up scandal upon the gods,
                caused by Eris’s spite towards the fact that she was the only uninvited god to the wedding. This small
                act eventually led to the Trojan War. Now, it is also a saying for when something small turns

            <p>Eris throws the apple, which is inscribed saying "To the Fairest," in an even distance between the three
                goddesses, provoking a dispute of vanity that Paris was forced to declare an end to.</p>

            <h4>"[Paris] had preferred the goddess Aphrodite, and now he was dead and his city ash."</h4>
            <h6>(Circe 352).</h6>
            <p>This validates that Paris' decision was fatal. By providing the Apple of Discord to Aphrodite and hence
                pursuing Helen of Sparta, he determined his fate. Paris stole the woman that Menelaus loved dearly, and
                therefore he declared war, in which Paris was unable to be protected, since Aphrodite has the sole power
                of controlling love.</p>

            <h4>"Paris, laughing thief of Helen's heart"</h4>
            <h6>(Circe 212).</h6>
            <p>This quote proves the cause of the Trojan War, which is fueled by Paris' mortal greed for love.</p>

            <h4>[Priam] "Who are you, son?" | [Achilles] "Son of Peleus" (Troy)</h4>

            <p>The following portrays the meeting of the Spartans and Trojans, which eventually led
                to the attack on Troy (The Trojan War). This relates to the apple of discord because Priam is the father
                of Paris who stole Helen from Sparta.</p>
